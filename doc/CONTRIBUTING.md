## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aincrad-Flux/TWIN
   cd TWIN
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up your development environment according to the project documentation

## Development Workflow

This project uses Git, so it is essential to create a new branch for any project modifications. A Merge Request must then be submitted for review.

### Basic Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Test your changes locally
4. Commit your changes following our commit conventions
5. Push your branch to your fork
6. Create a Pull Request

## Branch Naming Convention

We follow a specific branch naming convention to maintain consistency and clarity:

- **`feature/`** - Adding a new feature
  - Example: `feature/user-authentication`
- **`bugfix/`** - Fixing a bug
  - Example: `bugfix/login-validation-error`
- **`hotfix/`** - Fixing a critical bug in production
  - Example: `hotfix/security-vulnerability`
- **`chore/`** - Code cleanup or maintenance
  - Example: `chore/update-dependencies`
- **`experiment/`** - Experimenting with new features
  - Example: `experiment/new-ui-framework`

## Commit Message Convention

We follow a standardized format for commit messages to maintain a clear and readable project history.

### Format

```
[type](scope): subject
```

### Type

Defines the type of commit. Common options include:

- **`build`** - Changes related to the build system (e.g., gulp, webpack, npm)
- **`doc`** - Documentation changes
- **`feat`** - Adding a new feature
- **`fix`** - Bug fixes
- **`perf`** - Performance improvements
- **`refactor`** - Code refactoring without functionality changes
- **`style`** - Code style changes (formatting, whitespace) without logic modifications
- **`test`** - Adding or modifying tests
- **`chore`** - Non-impactful modifications

### Scope (Optional)

Indicates which part of the program is affected by the commit (e.g., UI, backend, api, database).

### Subject

Briefly summarizes the changes made, following these rules:

- Use the imperative present tense (e.g., "add", not "added" or "adds")
- Do not start with a capital letter
- Do not end with a period (.)
- Keep it concise (50 characters or less)

### Examples

```
[feat](auth): add user login functionality
[fix](api): resolve null pointer exception in user service
[doc]: update installation instructions
[refactor](database): optimize query performance
[test](auth): add unit tests for login validation
```
